    "## Introduction\n",
    "[RCSB PDB](https://www.rcsb.org) (Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank)  is a database widely used by scientists in many fields such as biochemistry. It stores structures of biomolecules, mostly proteins, that have been obtained by experimental methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project looks into what kind of structures are stored in the database, how many and how has the database content changed in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is divided into two parts. The first part uses API to obtain data from RCSB PDB and in the second part, dataset from kaggle is used instead. I worked with the kaggle dataset first to orient myself in the data and to try out some visualisation before working with the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following hypotheses are tested primarly in the first part, while the second part shows an alternative for only some of them."

    "The database was searched for several source and host species, groups and the three domains (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukarya). Grouped bar chart was used to compare the source and host organisms. Most biomolecules were produced in bacteria and the number of structures from E. coli almost matches the number for bacteria, therefore the host organism was mostli E. coli. However, the source organisms were mostly from Eukarya, big part from mammals and humans."
